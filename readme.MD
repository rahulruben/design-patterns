# Design Patterns Implementation

This repository contains implementations of several classic design patterns organized into three categories:

- **Creational Patterns**
- **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**

## Design Patterns Overview

### 1. **Creational Patterns**
   - **Singleton Pattern**  
   Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
   
   - **Abstract Factory Pattern**  
   Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Strategy Pattern**  
   Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

   - **Facade Pattern**  
   Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding the subsystem's complexity.

### 3. **Structural Patterns**
   - **Strategy Pattern**  
   Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

   - **Facade Pattern**  
   Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding the subsystem's complexity.
